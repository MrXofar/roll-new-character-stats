# Roll New Character Stats
Rolling attributes in the Foundry system can be a bit cumbersome depending on what method is used. Whether you are completely writing out the /roll formulas, clicking on sets of dice multiple times and applying your method consistently accross new players in your campaign - the process to get a new character's attributes can take time away from play. 

Some folks are okay with this, as it adds to the suspense of creating a new character, however, for those who just can't wait to get to the game - and want a new set of stats now - **Roll New Character Stats** mod does just that. Players can find the dice icon in their token selection toolbar and results are presented in the chat window along with DM rules on how scores are to be applied. **Future** version will allow the results to be applied to target character sheet.

# Module Settings
Only the DM may edit preferences under **Configure Settings > Module Settings** so that their players always roll new characters using the same methods.

**Roll New Character Stats** also supports Dice so Nice! but is not required.
