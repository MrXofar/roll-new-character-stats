v2.2.2
----------------------------------------------
Implemented support for Dungeon Crawl Classics - "dcc". Purple Scorcerer Games has this stuff covered - but why not, right?
Added settings to hide/show method, difficulty, results, bonus and/or dm note in chat message.


v2.2.1 - 7/9/2022
----------------------------------------------
Fixed Hooks.on("renderChatLog", (app, [html]) to prevent console error when any other message is clicked.
Implemented support for Old School Essentials - "ose". Races do not exist in OSE - only classes. 
Implemented support for ToolKit13 Character Sheet (13th Age Compatible) - "archmage". Has weirdly named races in "Races" compendium. More research on this system required.
Hide Race drop down and Race Bonus columns for "ose" and "archmage" game systems.


v2.2.0 - 7/8/2022 
----------------------------------------------
A little house cleaning as always.
Removed "dnd4e" from module.json - it has issues with my module creating New Actor at the moment. Says "type" is not in the array of allowed types.
Modified "pf1e" to the correct value "pf1".
Added todo-list.txt to show at a glance what is marked up as TODO-PRIORITY in the code.
Changed /data/racial-bonus.json to /data/character-properties.json and expanded the json text.
Removed /scripts/character-properties.js.
Added vanilla pf1 races to /data/character-properties.json.
Added /data/pf1-flavored-races(not used).json - just to keep some of the "pf1 flavored race" entries handy.
Added /data/system-helper.js for getting game system specific data from json files. 
Modified DM Note to NOT display "over 18" rules when they don't apply* - even if "Allow Over 18" is not selected in settings.
*Over 18 setting/rules are ignored when scores are applied as rolled (not distributed) and there are no Bonus Points awarded.
Moved "abilities" (i.e. "str", "dex", etc.) to /data/character-properties.json under each game system.
Made changes to /scripts/dice-roller.js.getResultsAbilitiesText(), main.js, /scripts/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.js and /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html to accomodate "abilities" change.
Enabled [Configure Actor] button in chat message results for Pathfinder 1 "pf1".
Added some classes to /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html

Racial Bonus support for "pf1" still needs more work. (just kidding, no it doesn't - this is working fine now)

See /todo-list.txt for other items of interest

Changed 'Undecided' to 'Race Unknown'
Character name will default to selected Race when left blank or as "New Actor".
Added some more localization.
Made some changes to [abl]_final_score on /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html to work better with game systems using race items (i.e. pf1)
