Coming in v2.2.0
----------------------------------------------
A little house cleaning as always.
Removed "dnd4e" from module.json - it has issues with my module creating New Actor at the moment. Says "type" is not in the array of allowed types.
Modified "pf1e" to the correct value "pf1".
Added todo-list.txt to show at a glance what is marked up as TODO-PRIORITY in the code.
Changed /data/racial-bonus.json to /data/character-properties.json and expanded the json text.
Removed /scripts/character-properties.js.
Added vanilla pf1 races to /data/character-properties.json.
Added /data/pf1-flavored-races(not used).json - just to keep some of the "pf1 flavored race" entries handy.
Added /data/system-helper.js for getting game system specific data from json files. 
Modified DM Note to NOT display "over 18" rules when they don't apply* - even if "Allow Over 18" is not selected in settings.
*Over 18 setting/rules are ignored when scores are applied as rolled (not distributed) and there are no Bonus Points awarded.
Moved "abilities" (i.e. "str", "dex", etc.) to /data/character-properties.json under each game system.
Made changes to /scripts/dice-roller.js.getResultsAbilitiesText(), main.js, /scripts/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.js and /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html to accomodate "abilities" change.
Enabled [Configure Actor] button in chat message results for Pathfinder 1 "pf1".
Added some classes to /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html

Racial Bonus support for "pf1" still needs more work.
