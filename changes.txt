Add Shortbow ammo (Arrows) to character sheet - Missed adding Arrows for Shortbow Trade Weapon.
Flint & Steel was not beeing added to character sheet.

v2.2.3 - 7/12/2022
----------------------------------------------
Enhanced DCC Support
This release brings a couple new settings unique to Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC)
Number of Actors (Client) - Enter how many actors do you want rolled. Use with caution if Dice So Nice! is enabled.
Name Format (World) - Character Name format if no name is provided. (This will be opened up to other game systems in the future)

All Game Systems:
Dice So Nice! (Client) - If checked, and Dice So Nice! is installed and enabled, 3D dice will be rolled across your screen only.

DCC Enhanced Support:
Roll New Character Stats (RNCS) will now fully roll 0-Level DCC characters! Occupation, Equipment and Luck are all rolled when 
the Actor is accepted by the player. RNCS follows the rules for farmers, herders, slings, darts, etc.

Roll them Dice! > Configure > Accept > Play!

NOTE: As I was writing this release, I just remembered I did not set up a test for user permissions for Create New Actor or 
hide the Configure New Actor button. Please note, players will not be able to Configure > Accept New Actor if Create New Actor 
is off for the user type as set in Permissions. This is not a big priority at the moment and will be addressed in a future release.


v2.2.2 - 7/9/2022
----------------------------------------------
Implemented support for Dungeon Crawl Classics - "dcc". Purple Scorcerer Games has this stuff covered - but why not, right?
Added settings to hide/show method, difficulty, results, bonus and/or dm note in chat message.


v2.2.1 - 7/9/2022
----------------------------------------------
Fixed Hooks.on("renderChatLog", (app, [html]) to prevent console error when any other message is clicked.
Implemented support for Old School Essentials - "ose". Races do not exist in OSE - only classes. 
Implemented support for ToolKit13 Character Sheet (13th Age Compatible) - "archmage". Has weirdly named races in "Races" compendium. More research on this system required.
Hide Race drop down and Race Bonus columns for "ose" and "archmage" game systems.


v2.2.0 - 7/8/2022 
----------------------------------------------
A little house cleaning as always.
Removed "dnd4e" from module.json - it has issues with my module creating New Actor at the moment. Says "type" is not in the array of allowed types.
Modified "pf1e" to the correct value "pf1".
Added todo-list.txt to show at a glance what is marked up as TODO-PRIORITY in the code.
Changed /data/racial-bonus.json to /data/character-properties.json and expanded the json text.
Removed /scripts/character-properties.js.
Added vanilla pf1 races to /data/character-properties.json.
Added /data/pf1-flavored-races(not used).json - just to keep some of the "pf1 flavored race" entries handy.
Added /data/system-helper.js for getting game system specific data from json files. 
Modified DM Note to NOT display "over 18" rules when they don't apply* - even if "Allow Over 18" is not selected in settings.
*Over 18 setting/rules are ignored when scores are applied as rolled (not distributed) and there are no Bonus Points awarded.
Moved "abilities" (i.e. "str", "dex", etc.) to /data/character-properties.json under each game system.
Made changes to /scripts/dice-roller.js.getResultsAbilitiesText(), main.js, /scripts/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.js and /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html to accomodate "abilities" change.
Enabled [Configure Actor] button in chat message results for Pathfinder 1 "pf1".
Added some classes to /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html

Racial Bonus support for "pf1" still needs more work. (just kidding, no it doesn't - this is working fine now)

See /todo-list.txt for other items of interest

Changed 'Undecided' to 'Race Unknown'
Character name will default to selected Race when left blank or as "New Actor".
Added some more localization.
Made some changes to [abl]_final_score on /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html to work better with game systems using race items (i.e. pf1)
