v3.0.4 - 07/23/2022
----------------------------------------------
- Prefixed all css classes with "rncs-" and changed "stylesheet.css" to "rncs-styles.css" just to be safe after my screwup with input elements.
- Corrected v3.0.3 release date in changes.txt


v3.0.3 - 7/22/2022
----------------------------------------------
All Supported Game Systems: 
- FIXED - "Score*" and "* No scores over 18 allowed." text were being displayed when they should not be.
- REMOVED - "drop result here" tool tip removed from Configure Actor form Results column. It was annoying me.

Enhanced DCC Support:
- FIXED - Roll New Character Stats (RNCS) was causing style conflict with input elements on other modules. My bad.
    A kind thank you goes to @Mortati for reporting.
- Implemented Random character names - picked from "Appendix S: Sobriquets".
    This was a cool suggestion from @Klaus.

General:
- Some minor code refactoring.
- More comment cleanup.


v3.0.2 - 7/20/2022
----------------------------------------------
- Wait for Dice So Nice! Animation: Chat message will now only display after Dice So Nice! animation is complete - if installed and enabled.
    This results in a longer wait for all rolls to be complete and displayed (it's literally just a couple seconds between each roll).
    But it does add to the suspense a bit. :)

- Settings: Opened up "Number Of Actors" (world) setting to all game systems.

- Confirmation text will now show the number of new actors you are about to roll based on Module Settings.

- Clarified some comments


v3.0.1 - 7/19/2022
----------------------------------------------
Enhanced DCC Support:
Populate "Saving Throw" modifiers, "AC", "Init" modifier, and "To Hit" & "Damage" modifiers.

Corrected version tag for previous entry in this file. 


v3.0.0 - 7/19/2022
----------------------------------------------
Refactored lots of stuff. 
This just means I hopefully improved a lot of the code without changing the overall module.
The focus of this refactoring was to make it simpler for me to add enhanced game system support.
The use of gamesystem-actor-helpers makes this possible. Each gamesystem-actor-helper is customized to roll the appropriate
dice for "other properties" - i.e. hit points, money, equipment, etc. The base-actor-helper contains properties common to most game systems, while the 
game system specific actor-helper (handler?) handles the properties unique to the game system. 
At the time of this release, Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is the only game system with the enhanced game system support. I look forward to adding
enhanced support for other game systems in the near future.

Enhanced DCC Support:
More detailed description appears in chat as well as the Configure Actor window.
"Starting HP:" now shows in Configure Actor window prior to accepting actor. Value shown is result of 1d4 roll. Stamina Modifier shown in parenthesis.
Fixed - Farmer type now shows in Occupation field.
New Setting - Show Description (World) = "Hide/Show character description in chat message."

New Settings for all supported game systems
Remove Configure Actor Button (World) - "This setting will remove the Configure Actor button when clicked."
Show Condensed Ability Results (World) = "Display Ability results in condensed form if Show Results Text is checked."

Late Entries:
(v2.2.33) General: Hide Bonus Points column when "0 Bonus Points" is selected. 
                   Hide Score column when "0 Bonus Points" is selected and "Distribute Results" is unchecked.  
(v2.2.32) Enhanced DCC Support - Added more info in Notes tab.


v2.2.33 - 7/13/2022
----------------------------------------------
Enhanced DCC Support - fixed some more things
Determine hit points; roll 1d4, adjusted by Stamina modifier.
Determine starting money; roll 5d12 copper pieces.

General:
Fixed "Over 18 Allowed" setting which was not working properly.

v2.2.32 - 7/13/2022
----------------------------------------------
Enhanced DCC Support - fixed some things
Add Shortbow ammo (Arrows) to character sheet - Missed adding Arrows for Shortbow Trade Weapon.
Flint & Steel was not beeing added to character sheet.

New Setting: (All Supported Game Systems)
Hide Results Zone (World) - This setting will hide Results Zone when DistributeResults is unchecked.


v2.2.31 - 7/12/2022
----------------------------------------------
Enhanced DCC Support - fix slings 
Slings were not being added to character sheet


v2.2.3 - 7/12/2022
----------------------------------------------
Enhanced DCC Support
This release brings a couple new settings unique to Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC)
Number of Actors (Client) - Enter how many actors do you want rolled. Use with caution if Dice So Nice! is enabled.
Name Format (World) - Character Name format if no name is provided. (This will be opened up to other game systems in the future)

All Game Systems:
Dice So Nice! (Client) - If checked, and Dice So Nice! is installed and enabled, 3D dice will be rolled across your screen only.

DCC Enhanced Support:
Roll New Character Stats (RNCS) will now fully roll 0-Level DCC characters! Occupation, Equipment and Luck are all rolled when 
the Actor is accepted by the player. RNCS follows the rules for farmers, herders, slings, darts, etc.

Roll them Dice! > Configure > Accept > Play!

NOTE: As I was writing this release, I just remembered I did not set up a test for user permissions for Create New Actor or 
hide the Configure New Actor button. Please note, players will not be able to Configure > Accept New Actor if Create New Actor 
is off for the user type as set in Permissions. This is not a big priority at the moment and will be addressed in a future release.


v2.2.2 - 7/9/2022
----------------------------------------------
Implemented support for Dungeon Crawl Classics - "dcc". Purple Scorcerer Games has this stuff covered - but why not, right?
Added settings to hide/show method, difficulty, results, bonus and/or dm note in chat message.


v2.2.1 - 7/9/2022
----------------------------------------------
Fixed Hooks.on("renderChatLog", (app, [html]) to prevent console error when any other message is clicked.
Implemented support for Old School Essentials - "ose". Races do not exist in OSE - only classes. 
Implemented support for ToolKit13 Character Sheet (13th Age Compatible) - "archmage". Has weirdly named races in "Races" compendium. More research on this system required.
Hide Race drop down and Race Bonus columns for "ose" and "archmage" game systems.


v2.2.0 - 7/8/2022 
----------------------------------------------
A little house cleaning as always.
Removed "dnd4e" from module.json - it has issues with my module creating New Actor at the moment. Says "type" is not in the array of allowed types.
Modified "pf1e" to the correct value "pf1".
Added todo-list.txt to show at a glance what is marked up as TODO-PRIORITY in the code.
Changed /data/racial-bonus.json to /data/character-properties.json and expanded the json text.
Removed /scripts/character-properties.js.
Added vanilla pf1 races to /data/character-properties.json.
Added /data/pf1-flavored-races(not used).json - just to keep some of the "pf1 flavored race" entries handy.
Added /data/game-system-helper.js for getting game system specific data from json files. 
Modified DM Note to NOT display "over 18" rules when they don't apply* - even if "Allow Over 18" is not selected in settings.
*Over 18 setting/rules are ignored when scores are applied as rolled (not distributed) and there are no Bonus Points awarded.
Moved "abilities" (i.e. "str", "dex", etc.) to /data/character-properties.json under each game system.
Made changes to /scripts/dice-roller.js.getResultsAbilitiesText(), main.js, /scripts/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.js and /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html to accomodate "abilities" change.
Enabled [Configure Actor] button in chat message results for Pathfinder 1 "pf1".
Added some classes to /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html

Racial Bonus support for "pf1" still needs more work. (just kidding, no it doesn't - this is working fine now)

See /todo-list.txt for other items of interest

Changed 'Undecided' to 'Race Unknown'
Character name will default to selected Race when left blank or as "New Actor".
Added some more localization.
Made some changes to [abl]_final_score on /templates/form-apps/distribute-ability-scores.html to work better with game systems using race items (i.e. pf1)
